# khmer_sentence_generator
In this project, we utilize the DeepSeek API and Khmer words from Khmer dictionary provided by `seanghay/khmer-dictionary-44k` on [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/seanghay/khmer-dictionary-44k) to create Khmer sentences based on provided words. For each generated sentence, we include the given word, its part of speech, and its definition to ensure that each sentence conveys the correct meaning, especially for the target word. After this step, we will replace the target words with their homophone pairs and use these sentences to train our model to recognize Khmer homophones.
